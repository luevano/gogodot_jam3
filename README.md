# GoGodot Jam3

Entry for the [Go Godot Jam 3](https://itch.io/jam/go-godot-jam-3). Ended up calling the game *Snake-tronic* (it's a meme).

Made in *Godot 3.5-rc3*.

Similarly with [FlappyBirdGodot](https://github.com/luevano/flappybird_godot) you can find a devlog showing how I made the game in my website: [Creating my Go Godot Jam 3 entry using Godot 3.5 devlog 1](https://blog.luevano.xyz/g/gogodot_jam3_devlog_1.html).

Also, you can play the game on itch.io [here](https://lorentzeus.itch.io/snake-tronic), and find the jam entry [here](https://itch.io/jam/go-godot-jam-3/rate/1562701).
